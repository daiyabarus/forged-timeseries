# Jarvis

This is a Streamlit app for programming Python with Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files and folders:

- `src/layout/`: This folder is used to store layout-related files for the Streamlit app.
- `src/config/`: This folder is used to store configuration files for the Streamlit app.
- `src/utils/`: This folder is used to store utility files for the Streamlit app.
- `main.py`: This file is the entry point of the Streamlit app. It contains the main code for the app, including the Streamlit UI and the data processing logic.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python dependencies required for the project, including Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## Setup

To set up and run the Streamlit app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app by executing the following command:
   ```
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the Streamlit app is running, you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`. The app provides a user interface for programming Python with Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. You can use it to visualize data, create interactive plots, and explore different Python programming concepts.
